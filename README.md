# Blockchain Voting System with Zero-Knowledge Proofs

A privacy-preserving decentralized voting system using zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge proofs) for anonymous voting. Built with Hardhat, Circom, and Solidity.

## 🎯 Overview

This system implements a privacy-preserving voting mechanism inspired by Tornado Cash's architecture, featuring:
- **Anonymous voting** through zero-knowledge proofs
- **Batch withdrawal optimization** for efficient vote tallying (8 votes per batch)
- **MiMC hash function** for Merkle tree commitments
- **Groth16 proof system** via snarkjs
- Comprehensive gas cost analysis and performance metrics

## 🚧 Project Status

**Frontend:** Under development  
**Backend & Circuits:** Fully functional  
**Testing:** Complete test suite available in `Backend/test/sample-test.js`

## ✨ Key Features

### Zero-Knowledge Privacy
- Voters create commitments without revealing identity
- Nullifier hash prevents double voting
- Merkle tree structure ensures vote integrity

### Batch Processing
- Process 8 votes simultaneously in a single withdrawal
- Significantly reduces gas costs compared to individual processing
- Custom Circom circuits for batch verification

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time gas cost tracking
- Timing statistics (mean, p50, p90, p99)
- GBP cost estimation based on current ETH prices

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js v14 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Hardhat

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Root dependencies
npm install

# Backend dependencies
cd Backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Install Circomlib
```bash
cd circuit
npm install circomlib
cd ..
```

## 🧪 Testing

The complete voting system functionality is tested in `Backend/test/sample-test.js`.

### What the Test Does

**Test 1: Full Voting Flow (40 deposits + 5 batch withdrawals)**
- Deploys contracts (Hasher, Verifier, Tornado)
- Adds 10 candidates
- Performs 40 deposits (vote commitments)
- Executes 5 batch withdrawals (8 votes each)
- Measures gas usage, timing statistics, and costs

**Test 2: Voter Registration (40 addVoter calls)**
- Measures gas costs for adding voters
- Tracks per-transaction and aggregate metrics

### Run the Tests
```bash
cd Backend
npx hardhat test test/sample-test.js
```

### Expected Output
```
✅ Deposit 1 Gas Used: [gas amount]
...
✅ Withdraw 1 Gas Used: [gas amount]
...
📊 Total Gas Used (40 deposits + 5 withdrawals of 8): [total]
💷 Estimated GBP Cost: £[amount]
⏱ Deposit witness (deposit circuit): n=40 mean=...ms
⏱ Withdraw proof gen (batch of 8): n=5 mean=...ms
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Circuit Parameters
- **Merkle Tree Depth:** 10 levels (supports 1,024 deposits)
- **Batch Size:** 8 votes per withdrawal
- **Public Signals:** 24 per batch (8 roots + 8 nullifiers + 8 recipients)

### Gas Costs (Approximate)
- **Add Candidate:** ~50-70k gas
- **Deposit:** ~200-250k gas per vote
- **Batch Withdrawal (8 votes):** ~800k-1M gas
- **Add Voter:** ~50-80k gas

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Solidity** - Smart contract development
- **Hardhat** - Ethereum development environment
- **Circom** - Zero-knowledge circuit compiler
